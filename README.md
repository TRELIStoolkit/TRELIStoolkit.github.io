# TRELIS Toolkit

Open-access curriculum for training and retaining under-presented leaders in STEM and the Geospatial Sciences. The TRELIS Toolkit was led and put together by Michelle Stuhlmacher (@M_Stuhlmacher) and supported by Meghan Kelly (@meghankellymaps) and is available here: https://trelistoolkit.github.io/

## What is TRELIS?

TRELIS is a NSF-funded program to support early career women in the geospatial sciences. Since 2018, TRELIS has led four workshops for early career and established scholars to discuss challenges and opportunities in the field and learn from each others’ unique experiences. 

## Toolkit Resources

The TRELIS Toolkit is comprised of workshop curriculum developed by the TRELIS Leadership (Kate Beard-Tisdale, Laxmi Ramasubramanian, Diana Sinton, Sarah Battersby, Barbara Buttenfield, Karen Kemp, Elizabeth Wentz, and Stacy Doore) and is now available online to generate future conversations and workshops.

The toolkit covers 5 areas or "tools" including: communication and language, career trajectories, obstacles and solutions, work-life integration, and mentoring and coaching. The TRELIS Toolkit can be taken up in its entirety, or materials can be mixed, matched, and supplemented.  For example, the mentoring and coaching tools include slides on building a mentoring network and a hands-on worksheet to “map” out these support structures before setting mentoring goals (i.e., identify a key mentor that you’d like to reach out to).

## Carolyn-Merry Projects

The TRELIS Toolkit also highlights projects funded by Carolyn Merry grants and led by TRELIS Fellows. These projects include GIS Connect, Golden Compass, Grad Wings, and Geospatial Science Leaders and all support and expand the TRELIS mission: https://trelistoolkit.github.io/projects.html 

## Expanding the Toolkit

Importantly, the TRELIS Toolkit can be expanded for future workshops. Instructions for submitting questions, feedback, and additional resources are available are available below.

1. Click on the "Issue" tab at the top of the TRELIS Github repository.
2. Select the green button to create a "New Issue."
3. Give your "Issue" a "Title" and then use the textbook to provide feedback/edits, ask questions, or submit additional resources/projects.
4. Submit your issue by clicking the green button labeled "Submit Your Issue."
5. You can then track your issue on the "Issue" tab on top of the TRELIS Github repository. If all else fails, please reach out to Michelle or Meghan.
6. If you're experienced with Github, you can also create a "Pull Request" and edit the repository and website directly. We will then be able to preview and approve your direct edits.


## Special Thanks

The TRELIS Toolkit is a work of many! We would like to thank TRELIS Leadership for developing the workshop curriculum and the network of TRELIS Fellows for expanding the toolkit and providing feedback/edits on the website.
